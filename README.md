#SOWCOM
SOWCOM is a 3D integral finite difference reactive solute transport code. This code numerically solves the Richards equation to model variably saturated water flow, advection-diffusion-dispersion-type equations for solute transport, and chemical reaction equations to capture geochemical reaction processes. The code incorporates a sequential iterative approach to manage the intricate coupling between solute transport and chemical reactions, treating them as two relatively independent subsystems. Additionally, it allows for the definition of anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity within 2D and 3D geological domains, considering the physical and chemical heterogeneity of groundwater system. 

##Installation
The software is developed in FORTRAN language and is currently compiled on the Windows system with executable files. This software can be successfully executed on both 32/64 bit Intel computers.
The hardware requirements for program execution are modern desktop/laptop computers with 16+GB RAM.

##Usage
SOWCOM boasts a comprehensive simulation capability, encompassing various chemical processes such as aqueous complexation, surface complexation, acid-base reactions, redox reactions, gas dissolution and exsolution, cation exchange, mineral dissolution and precipitation. It also models the kinetics of aqueous and sorption reactions, as well as biodegradation.
